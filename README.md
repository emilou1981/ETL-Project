Dataset for Comparing the Prevalence of Adult Asthma and Air Pollution Particulates

For this ETL project, we will be compiling data needed to compare the prevalence of adult asthma to air pollution in the years of 2013 â€“ 2016.

The data set being used for adult asthma prevalence is from the CDC. We will be scraping the data for each year using Flask.

The data set being used for pollution particulates is from a data.world project titled U.S. Air Pollution Data.

The Adult prevalence rates are by state and the pollution particulate data is by county and state. We will provide the min, max and mean by state to ensure that any variances between counties within each state are visible.
